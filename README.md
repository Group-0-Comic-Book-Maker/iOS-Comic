# iOS-Comic
The iOS App for our Comic Book Maker.

#Zero Issue

This app was my contribution to Group 0's Hackathon project in the May 2015 cohort at The Iron Yard.  Our group was tasked with creating a comic book maker.


The iOS app takes pictures and lets you add stickers including masks, weapons, and sound effects to create a comic book panel.  When you're finished creating, you save the panel to the Rails server.  The front end website can then create a comic book scene using the panels made with the iOS app.

This app features camera functionality, with images saved to Amazon S3, and the links to the images and other information stored on a Rails server.  Its features also include being able to save the image to the device, and the ability to resize and drag around the stickers before you save.
